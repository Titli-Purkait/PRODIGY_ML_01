# 🧠 PRODIGY_ML_01 – Linear Regression Model: House Price Prediction

Welcome to Task 1 of my Machine Learning Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**!  
This project demonstrates a **Linear Regression** model used to predict house prices based on key housing features.

---

## 📌 Task Objective
Build a regression model that predicts house prices using training data containing square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- 🐍 Python 3.13
- 📦 pandas, numpy
- 📊 matplotlib, seaborn
- 🤖 scikit-learn

---

## 📁 Dataset
A sample CSV (`sample.csv`) was used with features:
- `GrLivArea`: Above-ground living area (sq ft)
- `BedroomAbvGr`: Bedrooms above ground
- `FullBath`: Full bathrooms
- `SalePrice`: Final selling price (target)

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- 🔥 Correlation heatmap
- 📈 Actual vs Predicted price plot
- 📉 Residual error distribution

---

## 📊 Model Performance
- ✅ **R² Score**: `0.81` (Good model fit)
- ✅ **Mean Squared Error**: `~3.13e+08`

---

🚀 Live Demo
Since this is a machine learning script, there is no hosted live version.
